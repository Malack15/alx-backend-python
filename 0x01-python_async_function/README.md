Asynchronous programming in Python, often referred to as "asyncio," enables writing concurrent code using the async and await keywords. This approach is particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks, such as handling web requests or file operations, where tasks can be paused (awaited) while waiting for an external process to complete, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. By leveraging asynchronous programming, Python developers can improve the efficiency and responsiveness of applications, especially when dealing with numerous simultaneous operations. The asyncio module provides a framework to manage asynchronous tasks, event loops, and futures, making it easier to write non-blocking code that is still readable and maintainable.
