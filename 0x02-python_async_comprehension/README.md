Async comprehensions in Python combine the power of asynchronous programming with the concise syntax of comprehensions. Introduced in Python 3.6, they allow developers to create asynchronous generators within list, set, dictionary, and generator comprehensions by using the async for keyword inside the comprehension. This is particularly useful when you need to efficiently process large amounts of data or perform operations like filtering or mapping over asynchronous iterables. By using async comprehensions, you can handle asynchronous data streams in a clean, readable, and memory-efficient manner, all while maintaining the non-blocking nature of asynchronous code.
